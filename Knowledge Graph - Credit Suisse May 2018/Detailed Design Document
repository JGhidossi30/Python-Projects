Front-End
The front-end of our project is located in the WebContent folder, which includes HTMl and CSS documents that show our raw "KSearch" tool.
KSearch is a search engine that is specifically designed in this limited context to display information based on Netflix solely.
By searching for Netflix, a simple Web Application will appear in the body displaying a correlation graph between subscribers and revenue, created using Neo4j.
By searching for more specific keywords, which is limited due to time constraints, other information can be displayed in the Web Application. Try "With a 10% in domestic, international, and total number of subscribers to Netflix, what is the revenue projection for Q2 2018?"

Back-End
We started by cleaning the data based on Netflix revenue and subscribers and then created a knowledge map based on the two using Neo4j.
We stored the relevant data in Excel sheets, which were used by the Python correlation calculator to determine correlations between the variables.
The resulting data was then stored in another excel sheet, converted into a CSV file.
The cleaned financial data was also loaded into the predictive model.

There were many constraints in this project including time and knowledge/learning issues. On day 1 we spent a great deal of time with a sponsor trying to undertand Neo4j, without much success.
Because of our loss of time trying to figure out the software, we were not able to get as much don eon this project as we wished.
